Tejas Mani  
Real-Time Computer Vision Engineer

I build production-oriented computer vision systems focused on high-FPS tracking, multi-camera pipelines, and identity stability under real-world conditions.

My work centers on:
- real-time tracking systems (95–120+ FPS)
- multi-camera association and re-identification
- debugging failure modes such as occlusion, motion blur, and camera jitter
- systems designed for continuous inference, not demos

Primary technologies:
Python, C++, PyTorch, OpenCV, YOLOv5/YOLOv8, ByteTrack, CUDA

Featured work:
- Real-time multi-camera tracking systems with explicit ID-switch mitigation
- High-throughput video analytics pipelines with sub-15ms latency
- Production-oriented ML pipelines with runtime metrics and logging
